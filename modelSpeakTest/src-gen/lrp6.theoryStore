Experiment s2 { "Simulation experiment (parameter scan) with either one or both internalization pathways active. In the case where only CIE is active, the predicted fraction of internalized LRP6 is lower than the experimentally derived values. In contrast, CME provides internalization dynamics that are too fast compared with in vitro measurements." } -> m2 -> r1
Experiment s3 { "Another parameter scan applied CIE-based parameter values for the internalization rate of WNT/LRP6 complexes in both membrane domains (i.e. inside as well as outside of lipid rafts; using model configurations with CIE either fit the early or the late internalization dynamics of LRP6, but none allows the exact reproduction of in vitro measurements." } -> m2 -> r1
